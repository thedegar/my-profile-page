		<h1>Tyler Hedegard</h1>
		<h2>Hoosier, Boilermaker, Engineer, Texan</h2>
		<div class="personal-statement">
			<p>Tyler grew up in Indiana and thought he'd be there his whole life.  It's funny how things don't always work out like you thought they would as a teenager.  Because things have changed...maybe even a trip to the moon is in the future!</p>
			<p>He stayed in Indiana for college (Purdue EE).  Then moved to Austin, TX for a job at Samsung where he's been for 12 years living in the pfun city of Pflugerville!  Several work trips to Korea over the years, plus a trip to Europe during college opened his eyes to the rest of the world.  Now he wants to explore and travel more with his fiance, Lila!</p>
